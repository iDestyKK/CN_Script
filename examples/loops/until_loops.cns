/*
 * CN_Script: Until Loop Example
 *
 * Description:
 *     CN_Script offers a new kind of loop called "Until Loops". These act like
 *     "While Loops", except the condition is reversed. So essentially we loop
 *     "until" the condition is true, as opposed to looping until the condition
 *     is false.
