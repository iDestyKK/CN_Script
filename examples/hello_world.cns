/*
 * CN_Script: Hello World Example
 *
 * Description:
 *     Function Calls in CN_Script are the mostly same as in C. There are a few
 *     twists which make it similar to C++, but you should feel right at home
 *     with this if you are used to C/C++.
 *
 *     This program just simply prints out "Hello World!\n". Simple.
